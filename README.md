# D3-Challenge

For this challenge, I used the D3 JavaScript library to generate an interactive scatter plot on healthcare data from the US Census. On the X axis age, household income, and poverty were analyzed against smoking rates, obesity, and healthcare on the Y axis. The user has the ability to filter through parameters to view correlations.
